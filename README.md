# pendulums_simulation
This code simulates n mathematical pendulums (bobs hanging by a massless thred),
all hanging from the same pivot with different lengths.

all have the same initial angle and angular speed (which can be determined in the start method).
changing the number of pendulums is done by changing n (1st line)

inspired by @CodingTrain's single pendulum simulator.
